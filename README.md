# ft_linear_regression

This is a simple Machine Learning algorithm capable of predicting the price of cars according to some data provided to the learning algorithm.

The aim of this project is to understand the basics of machine learning through the linear regression statistical method.



## How to Run

The project cointains two python programs:

```
  ./training.py
  ./predict_price.py
```
The first program expect some csv data (in this example I'm using the car mileage and the prices at which thhese car are sold).
Once the program is runned, a new file data.csv is created.

The second program uses the data.csv file to estimate the price of a car once the milage is inserted.

```
  python3 predict_price.py
  Enter a mileage: 180000
  4638.786203426802 $
```
